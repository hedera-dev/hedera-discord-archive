# Hedera Discord Archive

This repository contains conversations from the [official Hedera Discord channel](https://hedera.com/discord).

When a thread in one of the monitored channels is flagged as _resolved_ by a channel moderator, all the related messages are extracted and kept in sync by an [open source Discord archiver bot](https://github.com/neurone/discord-archiver).

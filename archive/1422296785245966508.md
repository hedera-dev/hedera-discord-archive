I was trying to set up a local node on my Mac, following this tutorial https://hedera.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-hedera-local-network-using-docker but after running docker-compose up -d
one of the containers just stucks and in the logs I get the error: A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: SIGILL (0x4) at pc=0x0000ffff87db8fdc, pid=74, tid=75. So can I somehow run a local node?
```

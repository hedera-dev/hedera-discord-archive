Hi everyone, I’m building a React dApp on Hedera testnet and trying to connect to the HashPack wallet using HashConnect v3. I’m running into an issue where my app cannot detect the HashPack extension in the browser, even though it’s installed and active.

Pls i need help with connecting my dapp to hashpack
```

Hey, so this package is maintained by Hashpack I believe, so you will need to reach out to them for support

Yes I was able to fix it
But I didn’t use hashconnect nor wallet connect 


I have to used Metamask 
Then connect my Hedera account to metamask….you know metamask use EVM address which that with 0x
So after getting the EVM address of the wallet I used mirror node to resolve it back into Hedera account ID that make use of the 0.0.63……,

So you can try and use that pattern 
Because the relayown from walletconnect isn’t working

hey @Tomachi Anura (tomachianura#0 937718972747485224) , we have 4 open issues, 2 of which are CI/CD related.

The best way for us to assign development resources to the open source project is to create an issue.

We manage it in this way, similar to other open source projects, to allow for transparency in changes, bug fixes, and feature additions for all those that use the library.

If your request is captured in the issues in the screenshot, we're on it!

Based on the title in this discord chat, I think this is actually something our library could work on. WalletConnect just sends the messages back an forth, so we should be able to configure the messages as required.

The walletconnect main repository does have 26 open issues, but also 1400 closed issues. As a large open source project, it is fairly similar to other open source projects I've seen - https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/issues

Let me know if you would like to work together in constructing an issue which would become a dev ticket to make sure we capture all of the required information.

Imho the approach is not correct, cause if you maintain a repo for Hedera wallet connect with the main purpose to only follow walletconnect path, which is clearly going EVM first (almost EVM only tbh), then I once again will tell you all: you’re pushing Hedera to an end guys

It’s absurd that you not only don’t test all the possible scenarios when signing, but on top of that you don’t even contemplate the possibility that a payload/tnx could possibly have to be signed from many different clients on different physical locations, cause this is mandatory not only for multisig stuff, but mostly to accomplish a full and real decentralisation

Wallet connect isn’t just for evm, they went chain agnostic and enabled support for other protocols two years ago and this is when we started work on Hedera wallet connect, to support the Hedera native flows initially and now the evm flows too, the idea was to standardise on a way to communicate between apps and wallets without needing to choose or implement specific wallet support. 

Now, on this specific issue, there is a HIP which needs to be accepted by the community, the change you require changes the protocol that was defined in the original hip. 

Once we are in agreement on how to proceed, work can start. I have shared the hip in the past, here it is again so you don’t have to look for it.

hello @Greg Scullard (gregscullard#0 429323958592995328), thanks for adding more content to this context.
as i've stated in the past, when using hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect:
- the multisig signed from different parts (backend and frontend), do not work
- the singlesig tnx, signed from different parts (backend and frontend), do not work either
- the errors have been reported widely by the Kabila Team

most of dapp using wallet-connect on their frontend, especially native builders, **are forced to stay on kabila/hedera-wallet-connect fork**, because it's fully working.
to be more precise, it works as expected, but the limitations of being unable to use multiple hedera nodes when signing via waleltconnect, and being forced to use one node one, **is truly limiting our development, and is not a real decentralised approach**

Under those considerations, **giving high priority to the native layer, and allow developers to leverage the maximum of the backend and the UX** is crucial at this stage.

I truly thank your efforts, but it's hard to believe walletconnect is **focusing on native layer**, when it's taking over a year to have such a basic thing sorted out!

```txt
think about it in those terms:
- hedera contracts uses multiple consensus nodes by default, and walletconnect fully support this, right?
but hedera native services, when building interaction between backend and frontend, are somehow forces to setup only one specific consensus node, otherwise walletconnect won't sign correctly, hence the tnx will fail due to invalid signature
- hedera contracts always had "batch tnx", or "child tnx" also called, but the native layer **just managed to have it few weeks ago, after years of waiting**. On top of that, there was no sync with hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect team, cause **de facto** now days we can't use walletconnect/kabila/hashpack to trigger a batch transasction as UI action even if now hedera relased batch on mainnet lately
so once again we have to wait, in order to have a full integration and once again we must postpone things, this hurts businesses and people guys.
- hedera contracts can sign only once, for all child tnxs, but when it comes to the native layer, the way you built it, **imposes that the UI must sign every single tnx in the batch, and only after those tnx can be added to the parent batch one**. This approach will risk to destroy the UX for native builders!!!!!

I'm afraid I'm a bit out of context as the core of the issue.  For multi sig TXs having wallets submitting is likely problematic (and will always be to the nature of the complexity).  If I were building something I'd rely solely upon `hedera_signTransaction` and orchestrate the assembly of signatures and submission to the network on the back-end so I could manage complexity (I'd also pick a good node to start with and not try to mess with multple conensus nodes).  IIRC there is a HIP that adds to HIP-820 to facilitate multiple TXs being signed by the wallet/controller that aligns with the `TransactionList` pattern (I'm not endorsing this, you'all know it gives me the heebeegeebees, but it is in the works) 

I'm afraid I'm just not seeing the spot where the train jumps the tracks here, I know its not working, jsut don't see enough of it to suggest an informed workaround in the short term.

this is all very disappointing.  We had higher hopes for the batch implementation of course.  Batch 10 is hugely limiting to swap routing and therefore TVL expansion. Releaving the limitation is pivotal to growth across a wide variety of DAPP that chose to build natively on hedera.  A choice that seems to repeatedly prove limiting  despite best intentions. The inability to support basic functionality usable by a retail audience is embarrassing

thanks for sharing.
we're already building on the backend (smart-node side of things), and already (forced, tbh) to use one node only.
problem is: even if we often fetch the list of healthy nodes from mirrors, de facto it often happens that this node results unhealthy, and this brings an awful UX for our customers, and lots of problems for us as well.

Being able to work, both from frontend and backend, in a **totally decentralised way**, meaning using multiple hedera nodes, is fundamental to the success of retails guys.

we can't expect people to "keep on clicking" until it goes trhough imho

building on that as a baseline expectation is a failure

Yes, I completely agree. Relying on a single node due to the current WalletConnect limitations is far from ideal — it not only introduces reliability issues but also restricts multiple use cases, as we’ve mentioned across several issues.

I'd say since 1 year or more as you know we’ve already created a fork and implemented several modifications to address different problems, but this really shouldn’t be the approach every builder on Hedera has to take just to achieve a “smooth” integration. Hopefully, we can see these issues resolved soon so that the ecosystem can move forward more consistently.

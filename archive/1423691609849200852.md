We've upgraded our mirror node to 0.139.0 and per the release notes, we ran into issues with /api/v1/contracts/call. I've reviewed the blog post but it's not clear how we can mitigate this issue. Sorry if I missed something but this is the issue we're running into the error below.

```
I believe this mirror node had a startDate defined in 2023/2024 which could be relevant. We've rolled back to 0.138.0 with no issues.

This only occurs because the modularized flow is now enabled by default in v0.139 as per the release notes breaking changes (https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-mirror-node/releases/tag/v0.139.0). It also only occurs for your instance because you're running a partial mirror node without full state that does not contain account 0.0.801. We're actually already in the process of improving this to not fail for partial mirror nodes (https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-mirror-node/releases/tag/v0.139.0)). Meanwhile to mitigate you can downgrade to 0.138, disabled modularized property, insert a dummy entry for 801 into the entity table, or wait for 0.141 with the fix.

Hey! The error failed store/add invocation means your DID Document couldn’t be stored—likely due to misconfigured IPFS, MongoDB, or missing Hedera credentials.

Please check:
    1.    IPFS node is running and reachable.
    2.    MongoDB is connected.
    3.    Hedera account has HBAR and correct keys are set.
```

I'm trying to connect my cloud to run a Mirror-Node, I'm trying to build a listener service for token creation, token balances, etc. I see Hedera Docs explain how to run the node using Google Cloud or AWS, but my provider is Digital Ocean, how should I write to code for that in application.yml.

My code looks like the attached image at the moment. I'm junior dev so apologize in advance if there's mistakes. Thanks

So the bit that you are looking at is for the downloader, it gives you the option to either sync from GCP or AWS

You will need to create either a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account if you do not have one already. The Hedera Mirror Node object storage bucket, where you will pull the account balance and transaction data from, is stored in GCP or AWS bucket and is configured for requester pays. This means the mirror node operator is responsible for the operational costs of reading and retrieving data from the GCP/AWS. A GCP/AWS account will provide the necessary billing information for requesting the data.

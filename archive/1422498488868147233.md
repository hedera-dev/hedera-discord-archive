here is my config yaml file:
```
  app-config:
    content: |
      hiero:
        mirror:
          rest:
            log:
              level: trace
          importer:
            network: TESTNET  # Select one of PREVIEWNET/TESTNET/MAINNET and populate below config
            downloader:
      #       accessKey: {GOOG1E/AWS....}
              cloudProvider: "S3"
      #       gcpProjectId: {projectId} # N/A for AWS
      #       secretKey: {GOOG1E/AWS....}
            startBlockNumber: 25541000
            parser:
              include:
                - entity: [0.0.6790117]

Hey! So in order to get the mirror node working properly you will need to have an AWS or GCP account setup and have your API keys handy and put into the importer and downloader as you will be pulling data down from either service (whichever you prefer).

Lets clarify what you are trying to do, so by the sounds of it you want to run your own RPC endpoint yes?

So if you are running your own RPC relay, you dont need to run your own mirror node - you should query the public mirror node

i need the mirror node cuz i am trying to build a data indexing service on my local env, so i think maintain a mirror node would be a better option for me

In that case you would need to have the downloader working, as the data is synced to your instance of the mirror node via AWS s3 or GCP

IF you want to be able to query data there is also a graphQL endpoint

yes, you can strip this down to speed things up and only sync the data that you would like, but from memory the current size is a few TB

Well there is the application.yml file that contains the default options that you can change, however you can be more granular with it. For example you can pull out the coniguration medata, let me see if I can do that for you

You might consider using our database snapshots to bootstrap your instance: https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-mirror-node/blob/main/docs/database/bootstrap.md. If you start a mirror node by default it will start from now. So it will not include any accounts from before now and those queries will 404.

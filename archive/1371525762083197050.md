Hey team, probably something stupid I’m missing, but I’m new and excited to try this out.

I can’t figure out how to start from a blank Solidity contract in the new Contract Builder. It auto-loads the ERC-20 template and won’t let me unselect it. When I try to edit, it says “Cannot edit in read-only editor.”

The Playground only supports Java/JS, and the Templates menu doesn’t show much.

Docs say we can author and test contracts, so how do I get out of read-only or just start from scratch?

Thanks!
```

Hi @JORDONE (jordone0102#0 1354906621033189719) - Great question and feedback. 

The Builder only supports Solidity authoring via the customization pane you have available on the left for each standard (ERCs & HTS). 
With Solidity, this is an approach that similar tools (e.g. OpenZeppelin Wizard) follow. 

For full-editing at this time, the available approach is to copy or download the code and edit via a local IDE (or something like Remix).

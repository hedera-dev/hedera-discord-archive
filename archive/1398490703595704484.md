Can we have transaction fee in Hedera Network not in HBAR? what I mean is let say in the wallet only has USDC, can we swap to HBAR or other currency by the wallet that only has USDC. Thankyou
```

Some wallets  might allow using other currencies with sufficient liquidity to cover network fees, but on Hedera Network, HBAR is typically required for transaction fees.

So basically its allowed that scheme, right? And we both know the HBAR is always the native token to pay the network, but I just want to ask about the feature that improve UX that does not have any HBAR, and how in hedera can do it. If u dont mind, share some documentation about it thnkyouuu

Yes, transaction fees on the network are paid in HBAR, there is no way to pay with a different token.

```txt
Paying with a different token would potentially negate the need for HBAR, it could result in the price of HBAR dropping significantly as a result of lack of demand and weaken the security of the network.

All public networks rely on "cost of attack" in some fashion as a security measure against malicious actors, Hedera is no different in that respect.
